3 layerd architecture
abstract method /interface

1) generalizing all superclass method and declare has a method
    obj implementation
    object corelation
    object utiliation

2)specification
def: 
upcasting :ref var of super type   and intinalizing with  subclass  object
derived class also called
creating a obj od subclass and storing it in super class
downcasting:
using same class refernce variable
converting upcaste back it into org  subclass usingref var 


objectt utiliazation layer:
utilizing upcasted ref var @returned by obj creation layer
call the generalizing method

3 layers:
obj implementation:
    user interface:
        implement properties into 2 diff class
        2CLASS: ATM:transsaction method, weB-tranfer method
        web  online payment
        atm withdrawal method
        user name ,accno,bank name,withdrsw method is same,currrent bal common for both subclass
        (generlisezed method declare in  super type as interface)

object creation layer:
    service layer aslso called
    creating a  obj we hv
    achieve upcasting concept 

object utilization:
    main method
    class name -main account 
    utilize upcasted 
    object ll sub created into utilize layer
    downcasting method

return type fin out person is right or not  for autehticate and security in 2nd layer service layer,object creation layer
and upcasting  ll be done ad  secured  layer
