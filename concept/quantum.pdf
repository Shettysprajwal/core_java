bit v/s qubit
binary computers
processor using transistor  to perform calculation
on off  or 1 0 
game changes with quntim computers 
processing and stoage of 1's n 0's of classical systems give way to qubits or quntim bits
qubit  is the fundemental 

qubitbit of data  - by a single atom that is one of 2 states denoted y |0> n|1> know as qubit :super posiion state  
o n 1 special combination being here and where together and connot be in super position  

classical computation 
data unit :bit  dark circle = 1 white circle =0
x=0 or 1
quntum  computation:
data unit:qubit 
uper arrow 1
down arorow =0 

power of qubits is their inherit ability to scale expoenntialy with posibilty of quantum superposition

2 qubit machine allows for 4 calculation ,a 3 qubit machine allow for 8 calculation
4 qubit machine allows for 16 calculation

if n=50 we hv abt 10 ^15 possible states of the quantum machine a no that exaveds the capacity of larger st conventional classical computer
n  qubits encode 2^n bit

wt is made of:
    qunatum particles
    alorithms
    hardware
practical implementation:
    ion traps
    nmr -nuclear magnetic resonnance
    optical phton computer
    solid state

    quntim resources:
        superposition
        entanglement:the corelation
        entangle:ability of quntum sys to exhinbit correlations b/w states b/w states within a superpositoin

        
alice bob(symbol):
if alicebob:ab=not euqla to  bob >a|bob> b
then the state is entangled
entanglemnt as a resource it is believed to be the main ingrefient of computational speed-up in quntum info protocols
