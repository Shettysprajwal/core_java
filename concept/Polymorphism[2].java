/**
 * - One entity showing different behaviour in different places is called as polymorphism 
 * - Types of polymorphism 
 * 1)compile time 
 * - binding the method declaration to method definition by the compiler at the compile time based on the arguments 
 * - since the binding is done before execution that is why we will call it as early binding 
 * - once the binding is done it cannot be changed during runtime and hence it is known as static binding 
 * - method overloading and constructor overloading 
 * 
 * 2)Run time
 * - binding the method declaration to method defination by JVM at run time based on the objects thats why we will call it as run time polymorphism 
 * - since the binding is done suring runtime thats why we will call it as late binding 
 * - once the binding is done it can be changed at runtime and hence it is called as dynamic binding 
 * - method overriding
