Core Java: A Comprehensive Overview

**History**
  Created by Sun Microsystems:
      Java was initiated by James Gosling in 1991, originally named "Oak."
  Official Release:
      Java was officially released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
  Acquisition by Oracle:
      Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, taking over Java's development.

**Evolution**: Java has undergone multiple updates, with significant versions including Java 2 (1998), Java 5 (2004), and the ongoing updates under Oracle's stewardship.

**Key Features**
  Object-Oriented: 
    Supports OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
  Platform-Independent: 
    "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  Automatic Memory Management: 
    Java's garbage collection handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically.
  Multi-threaded:
    Built-in support for multi-threading, allowing concurrent execution of code.
  Robust and Secure: 
    Strong memory management, exception handling, and a security manager define class access.
  Distributed Computing: 
    Facilitates distributed computing through networking capabilities.

**Why Use Java?**
  Versatility:
    Ideal for building a wide range of applications, from mobile to enterprise-level   systems.
  Large Ecosystem: 
    Extensive libraries and frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate) enhance development efficiency.
  Strong Community Support:
    Active community and continuous updates ensure Java remains relevant.
  Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
    Java programs run on various devices without modification, thanks to JVM.
  Performance: 
    Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and optimizations deliver efficient execution.

**Types of Java Platforms**
  Java Standard Edition (Java SE):
    Core features and APIs for general-purpose applications.
    Includes the basics of Java, such as JVM, libraries, and tools.
  Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE):
    Extends Java SE with specifications for enterprise-level applications.
    Supports web services, distributed computing, and large-scale applications.
  Java Micro Edition (Java ME):
    A scaled-down version of Java SE for mobile and embedded devices.
    Offers APIs tailored for resource-constrained devices.
  JavaFX:
    A platform for creating rich internet applications (RIA) with modern UI controls and media   functionalities.

**Running a Java Program**
  Write the Code:
    Develop your program in a .java file using any text editor or IDE.
  Compile the Code:
    Use the javac command to compile the .java file into a .class file containing bytecode.

**Understand the Process**:
    The JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the program on the host machine.
    JVM handles memory allocation, garbage collection, and runtime exceptions.
